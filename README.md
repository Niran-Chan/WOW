# Windows Always Translate
You can use this application to keep a persistent application always running on a side of your computer so that you can just copy-paste over as required, and its persistence goes on top of other EXEs as well. I originally created this to translate games while I am playing hence the persistent behaviour. I will be adding more configurations, and am hoping to eventually make it such that it can capture audio and automatically translate on the fly. 

## Installation
Since this will be a Windows-only project, feel free to download the compiled releases. If not, you can still build it from source.

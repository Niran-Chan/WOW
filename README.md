# WOW (Way to Overlay Windows)
You can use this application to keep a persistent application always running on a side of your computer so that you can just copy-paste over as required, and its persistence goes on top of other EXEs as well. I originally created this to translate games, so if there are any issues where the window is simply not popping up, try playing your game in *borderless* instead of fullscreen.

## Installation
Since this will be a Windows-only project, feel free to download the compiled releases. If not, you can still build it from source.
